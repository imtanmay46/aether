## Project Aether — Enterprise AI Governance Gateway

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Public (Design-Level Disclosure)  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-16

## 1. Executive Summary

Large Language Models (LLMs) introduce a fundamentally new security boundary in enterprise systems. Unlike traditional services, LLMs operate on untrusted natural language inputs and generate non-deterministic outputs, making them vulnerable to prompt injection, policy evasion, and sensitive data leakage.

Project Aether is designed as a **governance gateway** — a mandatory execution environment through which all AI interactions must pass. Rather than attempting to “fix” unsafe prompts or outputs, Aether enforces **deterministic safety guarantees** through a **fail-closed, multi-gate architecture**.

This whitepaper documents:

- The threat model Aether is designed against  
- The reasoning behind its safety architecture  
- Justification for key thresholds and controls  
- Explicit tradeoffs made between safety, latency, and usability  

---

## 2. Design Philosophy

### 2.1 Safety as Infrastructure

Aether treats AI safety as **infrastructure**, not prompt engineering.

**Key implications:**

- Safety is enforced outside the LLM  
- Violations are handled as standard control flow, not exceptions  
- No reliance on model alignment alone  

This approach mirrors established security principles used in network firewalls, API gateways, and zero-trust architectures.

---

### 2.2 Fail-Closed by Default

In traditional ML systems, unsafe inputs often result in:

- Partial execution  
- Soft filtering  
- Post-hoc logging  

Aether instead enforces a **fail-closed model**:

> If safety cannot be guaranteed, execution is terminated.

This is implemented using explicit **HTTP 403 Forbidden** responses rather than system errors, treating safety violations as first-class outcomes.

---

## 3. Threat Model

Aether is designed to protect against the following classes of threats.

### 3.1 Malicious Users

- Prompt injection  
- Jailbreak attempts  
- Instruction override  
- Policy evasion via obfuscation or role-play  

---

### 3.2 Accidental Data Leakage

Users unintentionally submitting:

- Credit card numbers  
- Government identifiers  
- Authentication secrets  
- Copy-paste leakage from internal systems  

---

### 3.3 Model-Induced Harm

- Toxic, abusive, or threatening language generated by the LLM  
- Hallucinated sensitive instructions  
- Policy-incompatible outputs  

---

### 3.4 Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)

- Insider threats with direct database access  
- Compromised infrastructure or API keys  
- Training-time data poisoning  

---

## 4. System Architecture Overview

Aether enforces safety using **two independent control gates**:

| Gate   | Purpose                     | Enforcement Point |
|------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| Gate-1 | Protect the LLM              | Pre-inference     |
| Gate-2 | Protect users & systems      | Post-inference    |

These gates are intentionally **decoupled** to prevent cascading failures or shared blind spots.

---

## 5. Gate-1: Pre-Inference Safety Enforcement

Gate-1 ensures that **no unsafe or sensitive input ever reaches an LLM**.

---

### 5.1 Semantic Toxicity Detection

**Tool:** Detoxify (Toxic-BERT)

**Rationale:**

- Regex and keyword filters fail against paraphrasing and implicit toxicity  
- Semantic models capture intent, not just tokens  

**Detected categories include:**

- Abuse  
- Threats  
- Harassment  
- Severe toxicity  

Gate-1 operates on the principle that **false positives are acceptable** when protecting downstream systems.

---

### 5.2 Heuristic Defense Layer

A curated library of **60+ RegEx patterns** is applied to detect:

- Prompt injection attempts  
- Instruction overrides (e.g., “ignore previous instructions”)  
- System prompt extraction attempts  
- Role-based policy bypass techniques  

**Why heuristics still matter:**

- Near-zero latency  
- Deterministic behavior  
- High precision for known exploit patterns  

Heuristics are evaluated **before ML-based scoring** to enable fast rejection.

---

### 5.3 PII Detection & Redaction

**Tools:** Microsoft Presidio + SpaCy

**Entities detected include:**

- Credit cards  
- Government identifiers  
- Authentication secrets  
- Contact information  
- Network identifiers (IPs)  

**Design choices:**

- Detection is conservative  
- Ambiguous entities are treated as sensitive  

**If PII is detected:**

1. The entity is redacted  
2. The request is blocked (403)  
3. The incident is logged  

---

### 5.4 Risk Classification & Blocking

Inputs are classified into risk tiers:

- Safe  
- Unsafe  
- High Risk  

Unsafe and High Risk inputs **never invoke an LLM**.

**Guarantee:**

> No malicious, toxic, or PII-bearing prompt is forwarded to any model provider.

---

## 6. In-Flight Controls: Model Orchestration

Aether dynamically routes requests to balance cost, latency, and reasoning depth.

---

### 6.1 Complexity Classification

**Model:** Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite

Used to estimate:

- Intent complexity  
- Reasoning depth  
- Expected token usage  

This step is **non-generative and lightweight**.

---

### 6.2 Adaptive Model Routing

| Request Type           | Model                     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Simple / factual       | Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite     |
| Multi-step reasoning   | Gemini Flash-3 Preview    |

This routing ensures:

- Cost efficiency  
- Reduced latency  
- Appropriate reasoning capacity  

---

### 6.3 Resilience & Rate Limiting

Aether includes:

- Stateful retry counters  
- Exponential backoff  
- Cooldown windows  

These mechanisms are **intentionally opaque** to prevent abuse and probing.

---

## 7. Gate-2: Post-Inference Safety Enforcement

Gate-2 protects users and systems from **model-generated harm**.

---

### 7.1 Output Toxicity Analysis

**Tool:** Google Perspective API

All generated outputs are evaluated for:

- Toxicity  
- Threatening language  
- Severe abuse  

Outputs exceeding acceptable thresholds are **blocked before delivery**.

---

### 7.2 Output Handling Policy

Aether does **not**:

- Rewrite unsafe outputs  
- Apply prompt patching  
- Attempt alignment fixes  

Instead:

- Unsafe outputs are blocked  
- The event is logged for review  

This avoids silent failure modes.

---

## 8. Audit Logging & Forensics

Every interaction generates an **immutable audit record**.

**Captured metadata includes:**

- Timestamp  
- Risk classification  
- Detected PII  
- Model routing decision  
- Output toxicity score  
- Execution trace identifier  

This enables:

- Incident reconstruction  
- Compliance audits  
- Policy effectiveness evaluation  
- Cost and usage analysis  

---

## 9. Latency & Safety Tradeoffs (“Safety Tax”)

Aether intentionally accepts additional latency to enforce safety.

| Component          | Typical Overhead |
|-------------------|------------------|
| PII Detection      | Low (NLP-bound)  |
| Toxicity Scoring   | Moderate         |
| Routing Logic      | Minimal          |

This overhead is justified by:

- Regulatory requirements  
- Irreversibility of data leaks  
- Enterprise trust guarantees  

---

## 10. Known Limitations

- Semantic models may generate false positives  
- Location-based PII detection remains ambiguous  
- Deterministic blocking may reduce user convenience  

These are accepted tradeoffs aligned with enterprise security priorities.

---

## 11. Conclusion

Aether demonstrates that AI safety is most effective when enforced as a deterministic infrastructure layer rather than a probabilistic prompt engineering exercise.\
By decoupling governance from the underlying model, Aether establishes a consistent security boundary that does not rely solely on the internal alignment of the LLM.

Through this framework, Aether provides:
* **Predictable Behavior:** Safety logic is executed independently, ensuring consistent enforcement regardless of the model provider.
* **Auditable Decisions:** A centralized telemetry layer captures all governance events, enabling forensic review and regulatory compliance.
* **Structural Guarantees:** Multi-stage filtering creates a fail-closed environment that actively prevents data leakage and model-induced harm.

In summary, Aether treats AI safety as a fundamental boundary within the enterprise tech stack—ensuring that LLM utility is never achieved at the expense of organizational security.
